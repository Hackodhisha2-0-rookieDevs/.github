Waste mannagement is a simple hack for a clean and healthy environment. In India, people generally know about the two types of waste and many of them often confuses with the product. So, we came up with a solution and created an AI- based web tool for claasification of waste - TrasHacküóëÔ∏è

## About the Project
We created a simple open-source web tool where the user can upload the file and classify the type of waste. The model was trained on more than 2.25 lac image data.
- Waste classification and identification
- Use of convolutional neural network,keras,image processing and Tensorflow
-  classifies the input as the Organic and Recyclable.
-  the model has very high accuracy of 93-94 identifying and processing the data. with only a loss of 30 percent.
-  Here we used a AUC curve as a metric of accuracy and loss.

## Future Enhancements
Since project is at the very early stages of it's development cycle we can expect the following things in future from the project:
- enhanced dataset can help to identify more types of Waste.
- We can further be able to let the user to just scan the waste through their camera. i.e live identification will be one thing we can expect out of it.
